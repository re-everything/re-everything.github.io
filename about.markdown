<p>Inspired by a colleague, I've decided to start my own weblog — a space to re-everything the thoughts that have shaped me since my teens.</p>

<p>This isn't just a blog confined to AI or tech. It's a mosaic of everything that fuels my curiosity and makes me <em>me</em>; Technology and humanity. Science and art. Religion, politics, fashion, music, finance, economics, personality and love.</p>

<p>Each post begins with a quote — words that once moved me, challenged me, stayed with me. From there, I'll share a piece of myself.</p>

<p>A quiet step toward the eclectic, ever-evolving cosmopolitan I hope to become.</p>

<p><em>*All thoughts shared here are my own, unless otherwise stated. I write with sincerity, not certainty — and in full awareness that I am, like anyone else, a work in progress.</em></p>
